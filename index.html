                        <div class="facts-text">Van Gogh stayed within what he called the 
                            "guise of reality", and was critical of overly stylised works.
                            He wrote afterwards that the abstraction of Starry Night had gone 
                            too far and that reality had "receded too far in the background".
                            Hughes describes it as a moment of extreme visionary ecstasy: the 
                            stars are in a great whirl, reminiscent of Hokusai's Great Wave, 
                            the movement in the heaven above is reflected by the movement of 
                            the cypress on the earth below, and the painter's vision is "translated
                            into a thick, emphatic plasma of paint"

                        <div class="facts-text">When most people think of Van Gogh, the first
                            color that comes to mind is a warm, golden yellow. Yellow
                            sunflowers, yellow fields of grain, even the yellow moon in Starry
                            Night.But Van Gogh’s paintings didn't start out that way.
                            As late as 1885, roughly halfway through the short decade Van
                            Gogh spent painting, he was still in his Dutch period, painting
                            works like The Potato Eaters, which feature dark, muddled, grays,
                            browns, and greens. Curious about this shift from dark to light, 
                            we decided to use data visualization techniques to better isolate
                            the moment of transition to a bright color palette.

                        <div class="facts-text">Vincent seems to nearly always be in a state
                            of artistic and emotional exhaustion.  As he arrives in Arles itself he finds a 
                            vacant room in a local yellow house for himself. Vincent begins
                            to artistically contemplate the fleeting nature of many forms of 
                            still life. He thinks about paintings dealing with seasonal flowers,
                            and thinks of making a defense of the artistic process which renders
                            permanent and eternal quality to the representation of flowers on the
                            canvas which do not wilt and wither with time.</div>
